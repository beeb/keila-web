# Forms: Create and Embed Newsletter Signup Forms

Create *Forms* to allow new contacts to sign up to your newsletter.

You can either use them as stand-alone landing pages or include Keila signup
forms in your existing websites.

In order to create a form, navigate to the *Forms* page and click on *Create new
Form*.

## Form Settings
In the *Settings* tab, you can configure your formâ€™s title, button label, as
well as an intro, fine print, and thank you text.

The fine print supports limited HTML tags, allowing you to include links to your
website or privacy notice.

The option *Require captcha* is generally recommended. Otherwise your newsletter
list may end up being filled with countless bot addresses which can ultimately
lead to your newsletter being classified as SPAM.

If you want to embed the form in your own website, make sure to enable the
*Allow embedding as HTML* option.

## Form Fields
In the *Fields* tab, you can configure which fields should be presented to
prospective contacts and which fields are required.

You can also adjust field labels and placeholder texts.

Right now, the following fields are supported:
- `email address`
- `first name`
- `last name`

Future versions of Keila will allow you to specify additional fields and tags
for contacts.

## Form Style
In the *Style* tab, you can configure the color scheme of the form.
