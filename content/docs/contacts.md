# Contacts: Manage Email Contacts & Custom Data

Subscribers to your newsletter are called *Contacts* in Keila.

You can see a list of all contacts on the *Contacts* page which is accessible
from the main menu:

## Contact Data

You can store additional data for every contact. This data needs to be in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and can also include nested fields.

## Importing Contacts

If you already have an existing list of subscribers that you want to import into
Keila, you can do so by clicking on *Import Contacts* on the *Contacts* page.

Keila can import contacts from CSV files. Make sure to follow the instructions
on the *Import Contacts* page to ensure your file is correctly formatted will be
imported successfully.

Use the checkbox *Replace to duplicates* to determine what should happen with
email addresses that already exist within your Keila project. If you check the
option, existing contacts will be updated from your import file. If you disable
the option, existing contacts will remain unchanged.
